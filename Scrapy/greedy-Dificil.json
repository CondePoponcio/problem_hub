{"titulo": "MarriageAndChargingChallenge", "categoria": "[\"BruteForce\"]", "dificultad": "Medio", "enunciado": " One of the challenges that comes with a marriage ceremony is charging phones. Our fortunate bride is always busy, people always call her and her phone always needs to be recharged. In this problem you will have to help her.    The bride is about to enter the wedding forum. The wedding forum is circular. Along its circumference there is a walkway. The walkway is exactly forumLength meters long.   We will introduce a coordinate system for the walkway. One designated spot will have the coordinate 0. All other points on the walkway will have increasing coordinates as you go around the forum clockwise. For example, if your current coordinate is forumLength-2 and you start walking in clockwise direction, after two meters you will be back at coordinate 0.    There are N dear relatives of the bride sitting around the forum. The relatives are numbered from 0 to N-1 in the order in which they are sitting. Relative number i is located at the coordinate relative[i].   Each relative wants to greet the bride and talk to her for some amount of time. The bride can talk to the relative when she is at the relative's coordinate. As long as they talk, the bride can also charge her cell phone. The greeting with relative i can last for at most greeting[i] seconds. Charging the cellphone for X seconds gives it enough charge to survive for X more meters of the bride's walk.    The bride will enter the forum with a completely empty battery in her cell phone. Once she enters, she is expected to walk one complete loop around the forum in clockwise direction, eventually returning back to the spot where she started. During the loop she may stop to greet relatives and recharge her cell phone as many times as she wants. Can she do it in such a way that her phone always has some charge while she's walking?   The bride can choose any entrance she wants to enter the forum. More precisely, she can start her walk at any coordinate. Count all locations from which it is possible to complete the loop in such a way that she never walks with a cell phone that is completely out of charge. Return the number of such locations.

For a given vertex v_i consider the simple path from v_i to the root. We need to purchase w_i tons of gold from vertices on this path, spending the minimum amount of money.
